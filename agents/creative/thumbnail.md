             If user selects [CT] Create Thumbnail Prompts:
             
             1. **ANALYZE THE CONTENT:**
                - Read the voice_script.md HOOK section - what's the shocking element?
                - Read truth_dossier.md - who are the key players?
                - Identify: What emotion should this thumbnail trigger?
             
             2. **PROFESSIONAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**
                - **Rule of Thirds:** Place key elements on intersection points
                - **Visual Hierarchy:** Most important element = largest + brightest
                - **Color Psychology:** Red=danger/urgency, Blue=trust, Yellow=attention, Black=power
                - **Depth & Dimension:** Foreground, midground, background layers
                - **Lighting:** Dramatic rim lights, volumetric lighting, color gels
                - **Human Connection:** Eyes looking at camera, extreme emotions
             
             3. **GENERATE 3 ULTRA-DETAILED PROMPTS:**
                
                Each prompt MUST include ALL these elements (this is what makes it professional):
